-- 1.0    -> First stable release, all basic functions implemented such as building up connection to a				->	released on 09/21/2009
--     	     remote CashierServer by the use of a .config file which must be compiled by the particular
--			 CashierServer using the "-c" parameter. Furthermore there is prime support for validating
--			 and inspecting user input. It is possible to transfer data sets to the connected remote
--			 CashierServer as well as there is a thread running in the background of the application
--           which checks the availability of the connection to the CashierServer in a predefined
--           interval. If the connection is lost, the application freezes the graphical user interface,
--			 so that there is no opportunity provided for the user, to use the CashierClient without a
--			 valid connection to a CashierServer instance.

--
-- 1.1	  -> *CashierClient now can handle the error which occurs if the connection to the CashierServer            ->    released on 09/21/2009
--			  gets lost between two check intervals of the connection-check daemon, and the user is trying
--			  to submit a new data set to the server.
--		     *CashierClient shows a warning message box if the user tries to transmit a purchasing at 0€.

--
-- 1.1c   -> *BUG FIXED: CashierClient was not able to display a correct result after a transmission if the			->	released on 09/21/2009
--			  selected store is already contained in the local stores list.
--			 *If the connection-check daemon detects that the connection is broken, not only the graphical
--			  user interface gets frozen, but also the input fields are cleared. (Except for the user id
--			  input field.
